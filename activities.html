            <h2>Exciting Activities</h2>
            <h3>• Entertainment</h3>
            <p>Most people visit Taniti to enjoy the beaches, explore the rainforest, and visit the volcano. However, there are other things to do, including visiting a local history museum, going on chartered fishing tours, snorkeling, zip-lining in the rainforest, visiting several pubs, including a microbrewery, dancing at a new dance club, seeing a movie, taking helicopter rides, playing at an arcade, visiting art galleries, and bowling. Also, a nine-hole golf course should be operational by next year. Many of these activities are in Merriton Landing, which is a rapidly developing area on the north side of Yellow Leaf Bay. </p>
